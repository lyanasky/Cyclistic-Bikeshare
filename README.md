# Cyclistic-Bikeshare
About Company

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships.
Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders.
Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the team needs to:
Better understand how annual members and casual riders differ,
Why casual riders would buy a membership, and
How digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends

Stakeholders:

Primary: Director of Marketing, Marketing analytic team.
Secondary: Cyclistic Executive team.

Statement of Business Task

This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of the usage patterns and behaviors of annual members and casual riders within the Cyclistic bike-sharing program. The primary objective is to identify key distinctions in how these two user segments engage with the service. By understanding the differences, the goal is to inform the development of targeted marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. The underlying motivation is the financial insight provided by the finance team, highlighting the increased profitability associated with annual memberships compared to casual rides. Ultimately, my analysis aims to provide actionable insights that can be leveraged to enhance Cyclistic's marketing approach and drive the conversion of casual riders into more profitable annual members.
